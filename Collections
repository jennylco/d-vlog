It must be recognized that many historically valued artifacts and documents have been destroyed, which can furthermore give the viewers an obstructed view of what a museum is portraying. Should the legacies of a museum be questioned? They are deeply embedded in colonialism and have aided in excluding the representations of various populations from their institutions. It is no question that they are a for profit organizations that are controlled by the Government to portray what they deem as relevant for public knowledge. Should the museums be decolonized and deconstructed then to portray a more realistic non-white history? Many questions should be asked upon visiting a museum such as: How are some objects acquired? What is being hidden from the public view and why? Who founded their collections? Who is included and excluded within the collections?
Consent: How are objects being viewed and shown? What about agency over the objects? Can they truly withdraw their objects if they wish to do so? 
More people should be involved within the minority communities to aid in making decisions on how objects are shown within museums should the object have a relation to their communities. But what of the objects that were acquired before this issue was raised? Do minorities have agency over them if the object was stolen?
